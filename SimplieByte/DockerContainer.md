# Docker Containers vs Virtual Machines

---

## 1. Problems We Face Using VMs

**Heavyweight:**  
Each VM requires a full Operating System (OS) + the app + dependencies.  
*Example:* If Ubuntu OS itself takes 2–3 GB RAM + storage, and your app needs 1 GB, you’re already using 3–4 GB per VM.

**Resource Limitation:**  
On an 8 GB RAM laptop/server, you can only run 2 VMs comfortably (since each VM eats a large portion of RAM/CPU).

**Slow Startup:**  
Booting a VM = booting a full OS → can take minutes.

**Duplication:**  
Each VM duplicates the OS even if all apps run on the same host.  
This wastes resources compared to sharing the same OS kernel.

## 2. How Docker Solves This

**Lightweight:**  
Docker containers share the host OS kernel instead of installing a new OS per container.

**Efficient:**  
Instead of needing 3–4 GB per VM, a container may need only hundreds of MBs.

**Faster Startup:**  
A container can start in seconds, compared to minutes for a VM.

**Density:**  
On the same 8 GB RAM machine, where you could only run 2 VMs → you can easily run 10–20 Docker containers.

## 3. Real-Time Example (Interview Style Answer)

**Question:**  
*What problem do we face with VMs and how does Docker solve it?*

**Answer:**  
> With Virtual Machines, the main problem is that they are heavy because each VM requires a full operating system along with the application. For example, if I have an 8 GB machine and I want to run 3 different services — say a frontend in React, a backend in Spring Boot, and a database — if I use VMs, each will consume a few GBs of RAM since every VM has its own OS. So practically, I can run only 2 VMs comfortably before the system slows down.

> With Docker, containers share the host OS kernel, so they are much lighter. Instead of GBs, they usually take MBs, and they start in seconds. On the same 8 GB machine, instead of 2 VMs, I could run 10–20 containers — one for React, one for Spring Boot, one for MySQL, etc. This makes Docker much more efficient for modern SDLC, especially in microservices architecture.”*
